# React.js: Formik: 
## Cart page (Checkout & Success)
### Description: Finish your project by creating the last of three cart pages - Checkout & Success pages.
As a bonus, you will learn a very handy and powerful form validation library - Formik.
Variants - (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works.
(see the description to 3rd work)
### Requirements: 
- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
### Functionality: 
- Form: Your form should have at least 5 fields
- Form: Every field should have a validation rule (i.e max length /
no special characters / only numbers), just required option - is 
not enough 
- Form: You should have at least one field that uses RegEx and 
at least one field that doesn’t required string value(i.e Phone 
number)
- Form: In the error message you should describe all errors in 
all fields with clear reason (i.e Email is incorrect, First name is
a required field...)
- Form: Error message should be a separate React Component
- After successful form submit - the user is redirected to final 
page (Success page)
### Code style:
- Use Formik & Yup libraries or any functionality related to form 
validation (fields validating, error messages, form submit)
